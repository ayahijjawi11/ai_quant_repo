# Quantum-Assisted Electricity Allocation in Crisis Scenarios

This project proposes a hybrid AI–Quantum approach to optimize electricity allocation during crisis situations in Palestine.

## Project Structure
- Data generation simulates electricity demand under crisis conditions.
- AI predicts electricity demand for critical infrastructure.
- Quantum optimization allocates limited electricity resources.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Qiskit (planned for quantum optimization)

## Current Status
- Dataset generation completed
- AI demand prediction implemented
- Quantum optimization in progress
